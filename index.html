                What actually happened at the meeting
                </summary>
                I argued a lot with Me about line breaks. I and Myself then tried to convince Me that
                line breaks were the way to go in moving forward.

                    Last time, Myself and I talked about how we are are dominating the <i>first person</i> market.
                    It is of <em class="emphasize">significant</em> importance, that we plan for the unforseen future
                    and tackle our competitors in the <i>second person</i> market. If that is not possible, then we 
                    should consider methods to expand and make the <i>second person</i> market obsolete.

                    <summary>Details</summary>
                    According to our <span class="workers">financial speculators</span>, the second person market is estimated
                    to be worth around 8 words. Somehow, our think tank thinks that using line breaks will
                    let us gain a word on our competitors.

                    Apparently, I couldn't bother to make a graph about our profit margins and decided to share a meme
                    about graphs at the last meeting. Somehow, Myself thought it was funny and decided to put it on today's
                    meeting minutes. (Credits for the meme goes to <a href="https://xkcd.com/688/">xkcd.com</a>)

            <h2>New Business</h2>
            <section class="newbusiness">
                <p> 
                    Accordingly, our rival competitors <b class="competitors">You and Yourself,</b> have developed 
                    a new technology. They call it the <strong> "third party"</strong>. We're not sure about what this
                    means for the current playing field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There has been talk lately about a new technology called line breaks. <br>
                    Apparently it is supposed to be used intelligently to <br>
                    make text look really <br>
                    nice. But for some <br>
                    reason our tech <br>
                    monkeys can't <br>
                    figure it <br>
                    out.
